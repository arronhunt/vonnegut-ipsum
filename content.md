Goodbye Blue Monday.
We are healthy only to the extent that our ideas are humane.
Science is magic that works.
God bless you, Mr. Rosewater.
Hello babies.
Welcome to Earth.
It's hot in the summer and cold in the winter.
It's round and wet and crowded.
On the outside, babies, you've got a hundred years here.
There's only one rule that I know of, babies.
God damn it, you've got to be kind.
No damn cat. No damn cradle.
Ting-a-ling mother fucker.
If this isn't nice, I don't know what is.
Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt.
Killgore trout eating a tralfamadorian breakfast of champions.
Wide open beavers inside a hoosier catâ€™s cradle.
I have become unstuck in time.
Slaughterhouse ice-nine karass with bokonon.
Poo-tee-weet.
So it goes.
Life is no way to treat an animal.
Welcome to the monkey house.
It is harder to be unhappy when you are eating.
